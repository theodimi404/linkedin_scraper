# Linkedin Scraper

This project is a scraper that extracts data from the user's connections on Linkedin. It requires the username and the password of the user.
When the credentials are given, it saves a .xlsx file, that contains the following info if available of every connection that the user has.

- Profile url 
- Email
- Date that the user connected with him/her
- Birthday
- If he/she is currently working somewhere

## Disclaimer

I built this project, only to strength my skills on web scraping and find out more on this field. It is not recommended to use it by all means.
